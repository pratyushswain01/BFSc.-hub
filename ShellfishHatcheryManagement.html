Its key principle is the separation of processes: rearing of broodstock, spawning, hatching, larval rearing, and live feed culture are all conducted in separate tanks. Because live feeds are not cultured within the larval rearing tanks (LRTs), the water remains clear. This controlled environment leads to higher survival rates and more economical seed production compared to the Japanese system, making it the widely followed method in most countries.</p></div></details>

Its physiological purpose is to remove the X-organ-sinus-gland complex, which produces Gonad Inhibiting Hormone (GIH). By removing the source of this inhibitory hormone, the animal's own Gonad Stimulating Hormone (GSH) can act freely, inducing rapid ovarian maturation and spawning. <strong>Unilateral ablation</strong> (removing one eyestalk) is the standard practice as it provides sufficient hormonal stimulus without causing excessive mortality. <strong>Bilateral ablation</strong> (removing both) often leads to physiological stress, high mortality, and reabsorption of eggs.</p></div></details>

It is transparent, flat, and leaf-shaped (phyllo = leaf, soma = body), a morphology adapted for a long planktonic life. They have very long, jointed appendages used for swimming and are dispersed far and wide by ocean currents.

Spat collection is the practice of providing artificial substrates in natural waters during the peak spawning season to collect these settling juveniles for aquaculture. Common materials used as spat collectors include: <br>1. <strong>Lime-coated tiles:</strong> Semi-cylindrical roofing tiles coated with lime provide an attractive surface for oyster spat to attach. <br>2. <strong>Shell strings (Rens):</strong> Strings of old oyster or scallop shells are hung from rafts or racks, providing a natural and effective collection surface. <br>3. <strong>Rope collectors:</strong> Coir or synthetic ropes, often with untwisted filaments, offer a large surface area for mussel spat to attach.</p></div></details>

They are rich in protein and lipids, providing essential nutrients for growth and survival. A key advantage is that they are available as dormant cysts that can be stored for long periods and hatched on demand. <br><strong>"Shell Free Artemia"</strong> are cysts that have been chemically treated (decapsulated) to remove the hard, indigestible outer shell. Their advantages include: 100% usability (no unhatched cysts), no need for a 24-hour hatching process, and higher energy content since the nauplius hasn't consumed its yolk sac reserves.</p></div></details>

In a hatchery, uneaten feed and animal excretion produce highly toxic ammonia (NH3). A biofilter provides a large surface area (using bio-balls, beads, etc.) for colonies of nitrifying bacteria to grow. The process occurs in two steps: <br>1. Bacteria of the genus <strong>*Nitrosomonas*</strong> consume ammonia and convert it into less toxic nitrite (NO2-). <br>2. Bacteria of the genus <strong>*Nitrobacter*</strong> then consume the nitrite and convert it into harmless nitrate (NO3-). This process, called <strong>nitrification</strong>, is essential for maintaining water quality in recirculating hatchery systems.</p></div></details>

It is a single-cell protein source containing 55-70% protein with an excellent amino acid profile. It is also rich in vitamins (especially B-12), minerals, and natural pigments like carotene and xanthophyll. A key advantage is its soft cell wall made of complex sugars, which makes it highly digestible for larval animals.

The female must be sexually mature with a hardened exoskeleton to mate. The male deposits a spermatophore which is held externally for only a few hours before spawning. Their reproductive sequence is: <strong>molt -> mature -> mate -> spawn</strong>. <br><strong>Closed Thelycum Species</strong> (*Penaeus* subgenus, e.g., *P. monodon*): The thelycum is a more complex internal structure with lateral plates that enclose a seminal receptacle. Mating can only occur immediately after the female molts, while her exoskeleton is still soft. The spermatophore is stored internally and protected as the shell hardens, and can be retained for one or several spawnings.

The development from a hatched egg takes approximately 23-31 days. <br>1. <strong>Egg to Zoea:</strong> After an incubation period of about 2 weeks, the fertilized eggs carried by the female ("berried" female) hatch into the first larval stage, the Zoea. <br>2. <strong>Zoeal Stages (5 stages):</strong> The zoea larva is planktonic and undergoes five successive moults. Each stage lasts 3-4 days. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Zoea I:</strong> Eyes are sessile (not on stalks). 5 abdominal segments. Telson has 3+3 spines. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Zoea II:</strong> Eyes become stalked. Telson now has 4+4 spines. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Zoea III:</strong> The abdomen develops a 6th segment. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Zoea IV:</strong> Pleopod buds (rudimentary swimming legs) appear on the abdominal segments. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Zoea V:</strong> Setae (bristles) appear on the pleopods. Telson has 5+5 spines. <br>3. <strong>Megalopa Stage:</strong> After the 5th zoeal stage, the larva metamorphoses into the Megalopa. This stage lasts 8-11 days and has a more crab-like appearance. The carapace is longer than it is wide, and it has well-developed chelipeds (claws) and four pairs of walking legs. It uses its five pairs of pleopods for swimming. <br>4. <strong>First Crab Instar:</strong> The Megalopa moults into the First Crab Instar, which is a miniature version of the adult crab. It has a carapace with nine anterolateral spines on each side and its last pair of legs has a paddle-shaped dactylus. At this point, it settles to the bottom and begins its benthic life.</p></div></details>

It secretes several neurohormones, most importantly the <strong>Gonad Inhibiting Hormone (GIH)</strong> and <strong>Moult Inhibiting Hormone (MIH)</strong>. GIH (also called OIH or VIH) actively suppresses ovarian development and vitellogenesis (yolk formation).</li><li><strong>Thoracic Ganglia:</strong> This gland secretes <strong>Gonad Stimulating Hormone (GSH)</strong>, which promotes the development of gonads, gametogenesis, and prepares the animal for breeding. The secretion of GSH is believed to be triggered by a releasing factor from the supra-oesophageal ganglia.</li><li><strong>Y-Organ:</strong> Located in the antennary/maxillary segment, this gland secretes the moulting hormone <strong>ecdysone</strong>. Its activity is inhibited by MIH from the X-organ. Since moulting and reproduction are often linked, this creates an indirect reproductive control pathway.</li><li><strong>Mandibular Organ:</strong> This organ synthesizes <strong>methyl farnesoate (MF)</strong>, a substance that has a stimulatory effect on the Y-organ, encouraging it to secrete ecdysone, thereby promoting moulting and indirectly influencing the reproductive cycle.</li><li><strong>Androgenic Gland (Males only):</strong> This gland secretes <strong>androgenic hormone (AH)</strong>, which is crucial for controlling all primary and secondary male sexual characteristics, including spermatogenesis. Its presence determines the development of testes; its absence allows for the development of an ovary.</li></ul><p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">The overall process is a balance: GSH promotes maturation, while GIH from the eyestalks holds it in check. This is why eyestalk ablation is an effective technique in hatcheries to induce maturation by removing the source of the inhibitory hormone.</p></div></details>

Detail the process and importance of eyestalk ablation in shrimp hatcheries.</span><span class="arrow transition-transform duration-300 transform text-blue-500">&#9654;</span></summary><div class="mt-4 pt-4 border-t border-gray-200 answer-block p-4 rounded-md"><p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Importance:</strong> Many commercially important shrimp species, like *P. monodon*, do not readily mature and spawn in captivity. This is because the X-organ-sinus-gland complex in their eyestalks produces Gonad Inhibiting Hormone (GIH), which suppresses ovarian development. Eyestalk ablation is a crucial hatchery technique used to remove this source of inhibition, thereby allowing the shrimp's natural Gonad Stimulating Hormone (GSH) to promote rapid maturation of the ovaries, leading to spawning. It is an essential prerequisite for captive breeding programs. <br><br><strong>Process and Methods:</strong> The procedure is performed only on inter-molt females. To minimize stress and mortality, the shrimp is often chilled before the procedure. The standard practice is unilateral ablation (removing only one eyestalk). Common methods include: <br>1. <strong>Electrocauterization:</strong> The eyestalk is cut near the base with scissors, and the wound is immediately sealed with a heated instrument (like a pencil-type soldering iron) to prevent bleeding (hemolymph loss) and infection. This is a very effective method. <br>2. <strong>Enucleation (Pinching):</strong> The eyestalk is grasped firmly behind the eyeball and squeezed hard, forcing the contents of the eye out. This method is simple and promotes rapid clotting within the empty eyestalk. <br>3. <strong>Ligation:</strong> A string is tied tightly around the base of the eyestalk, cutting off circulation and causing it to fall off within a few days. This method avoids an open wound but is slower and less predictable. <br><br><strong>Effects and Drawbacks:</strong> After successful ablation, ovarian development can begin within 3 days, with a first spawn possible within a week. However, there are drawbacks. The resulting eggs and larvae are often considered inferior in quality and viability compared to those from wild-matured females. The hormonal imbalance can lead to improper nutrient storage, lower embryonic development, and reduced juvenile survival.</p></div></details>

They are acclimated and disinfected (e.g., 100 ppm formalin dip) before being placed in maturation tanks. Unilateral eyestalk ablation is performed to induce maturation. <br>2. <strong>Spawning:</strong> Ablated females are stocked with males (ratio 1:1 or 1.5:1) in maturation tanks. After mating, impregnated females are transferred to individual spawning tanks. A single female can produce 8-10 lakhs (0.8-1 million) eggs. Hatching occurs in the early morning, with a hatchability rate of 95-100%. <br>3. <strong>Larval Rearing (in LRTs):</strong> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Nauplius (N1-N6):</strong> Lasts 36-48 hours.

This is the first feeding stage. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Mysis (M1-M3):</strong> Lasts 3-4 days. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Post-Larvae (PL):</strong> The Mysis III metamorphoses into PL1. The total larval rearing duration is about 13-15 days. <br>4. <strong>Feeding Regime:</strong> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Zoea Stage (Day 1-5):</strong> Fed exclusively on microalgae like *Chaetoceros* or *Skeletonema* at a density of 100,000 cells/ml. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Mysis Stage (Day 6-10):</strong> Continue with microalgae and introduce freshly hatched *Artemia* nauplii, starting at 0.25 nauplii/ml and increasing to 0.5 nauplii/ml. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Post-Larval Stage (Day 11+):</strong> The microalgae density is reduced (e.g., to 60,000 cells/ml), and the *Artemia* density is increased to 1 nauplius/ml. Artificial feeds (microencapsulated diets or egg custard) are also introduced. <br>5. <strong>Water Management:</strong> Water exchange starts at 30% daily during the Zoea stage and increases to 70-100% during the Mysis and PL stages to maintain optimal water quality. <br>6. <strong>Harvest:</strong> With an average survival rate of 20%, a single 100g breeder can yield 1.0 to 2.5 lakhs (100,000 to 250,000) PLs per cycle.</p></div></details>

Larval stages are highly vulnerable to diseases, which can cause mass mortality and complete crop failure. Common challenges include: <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Bacterial Diseases:</strong> Luminous bacterial disease (*Vibrio harveyi*), Vibriosis, and Bacterial Necrosis can affect all larval stages. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Fungal Diseases:</strong> Caused by fungi like *Lagenidium*, which are particularly dangerous to Mysis stages. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Viral Diseases:</strong> Baculovirus and Parvovirus (IHHNV) can cause high mortality, especially in post-larval stages. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Larval Fouling:</strong> Epibionts like *Zoothamnium* and *Vorticella* can attach to gills and appendages, causing hypoxia and death. <br><br><strong>Management Strategies (Disinfection & Prevention):</strong> The best strategy is prevention through strict sanitation and disinfection to break the life cycle of pathogens between production cycles. This involves a combination of physical and chemical methods: <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Physical Methods:</strong> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • <strong>Cleaning & Dehydration:</strong> Thoroughly scrubbing and drying all tanks, pipes, and equipment kills fragile pathogens and removes the organic substrate they grow on. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • <strong>Filtration:</strong> Mechanical and biological filtration of incoming and recirculating water removes suspended solids and associated microbes. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • <strong>UV Radiation:</strong> Treating water with UV light (2500-2650 Å) is highly effective at destroying viruses, bacteria, and fungi without leaving chemical residues. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Chemical Methods:</strong> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • <strong>Chlorination:</strong> Treating water with calcium or sodium hypochlorite is a common and effective method, but residual chlorine must be completely removed (e.g., by aeration or charcoal filtration) before use. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • <strong>Formalin:</strong> Used as a dip for brooders and to disinfect equipment and water. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • <strong>Ozonation:</strong> Highly effective but requires expensive equipment. Residual ozone must also be removed. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • <strong>Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (QACs) & Iodophores:</strong> Used for disinfecting surfaces and equipment.</p></div></details>

Describe the process of hatchery-based seed production for holothurians (sea cucumbers).</span><span class="arrow transition-transform duration-300 transform text-blue-500">&#9654;</span></summary><div class="mt-4 pt-4 border-t border-gray-200 answer-block p-4 rounded-md"><p class="text-gray-700">Hatchery production of holothurians (*Holothuria scabra*) is crucial for replenishing over-exploited wild stocks. The process involves several key steps: <br>1. <strong>Broodstock Management:</strong> Large, healthy adults (>150mm) are collected by divers from the wild. In the hatchery, they are maintained in tanks with a 15cm mud/sand substrate to allow for natural burying behavior. Water is changed daily. <br>2. <strong>Induced Spawning:</strong> Spawning is induced using <strong>thermal stimulation</strong>. During the natural breeding season (March-May), the water temperature in the spawning tank is raised by 3-5°C. This prompts the males to spawn first, releasing sperm while adopting a "cobra-like" posture. The presence of sperm in the water then stimulates the females to release their oocytes. <br>3. <strong>Fertilization:</strong> Fertilization is external. After spawning, the adults are removed, and the eggs are washed several times with fresh seawater to remove excess sperm, which can cause deformities. <br>4. <strong>Larval Rearing:</strong> The fertilized eggs develop through several distinct planktonic larval stages. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Auricularia:</strong> Hatches after ~24-30 hours. This is the first feeding stage. The larvae are fed microalgae like *Isochrysis galbana* and *Chaetoceros* at a density of 20,000-30,000 cells/ml. This stage lasts about 10 days. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Doliolaria:</strong> The late auricularia transforms into a non-feeding, barrel-shaped doliolaria larva with ciliary bands for swimming. This is a transitional stage lasting a few days. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Pentactula:</strong> The doliolaria develops into a pentactula larva, which has five tentacles at its anterior end and a tube foot for locomotion. This stage begins to settle. <br>5. <strong>Settlement and Juvenile Rearing:</strong> The pentactula larvae settle on the bottom of the tank and metamorphose into juvenile sea cucumbers. They are very secretive and require suitable substrates to hide. Growth is slow, and they are reared in the hatchery until they are large enough for sea ranching.</p></div></details>
